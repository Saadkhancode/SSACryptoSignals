      <h2>Cancellations</h2>
      <p>The subscription is recurring, as indicated when you purchase it. However, you can cancel it whenever you want in your customer area of the website or by sending us an email at support@ssacryptosignal.com at least one week before the renewal. The subscription fee will not be refunded in any case if negligence on the part of the client leads to failure to cancel on time. Similarly, pursuant to article 103 of Law 3/2014 of 27 March, the transactions covered by these terms and conditions are excluded from the right of withdrawal and, therefore, constitute one of the exceptions to the right of reimbursement once the service has been provided and the enjoyment of the service has commenced.</p>
